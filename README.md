# Vehicle-Booking
The Vehicle Booking and Checking Tool has been design to meet the needs of booking a vehicle pool for an event. In addition to booking the vehicle it can also be checked out and in. The design allows for check out or in to be done via a hand held device capable of running Excel including VBA off line and then those details be uploaded to the master data. Note check out or in data could be captured by a pdf rendition of the form but would then have to be manually rekeyed to the master.

The tool has five main interfaces:
<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
<li>Basic table level data entry. Used to set up vehicle (including any vehicle packs) and lookup data.</li>
<li>Vehicle Booking, allows a vehicle to be booking for a period of time. Validation ensure data validated, but if data has been entered directly to the table producing a conflict in booking, this is highlighted as a double booking.</li>
<li>Vehicle Check, allows a vehicle to be checked on the way out and back in through a form. The vehicle check is saved so details including damage are captured both on the way out and in.</li>
<li>Reports, accessed from the Tab Ribbon, are used to view and print information in a user friendly form. The reports provide a snap shot view of the underlying data.</li>
<li>Upload Check Data, accessed from the Tab Ribbon, allows check out and in data captured in the workbook offline, e.g. from a tablet device, to be uploaded to a central master workbook. This allows for multiple user to be checking out and in vehicles, then upload data to the master later.</li>
</ul>
